# Induction and Offboarding for SSI staff


## Induction

When new staff join the SSI, they should be assigned a line manager and a minder that can help them get started at the SSI. The line manager will normally be their line manager at the University they are based in. The minder can be anyone in the SSI team, but it is often useful for the person to be based at the same site.

Each site has its own induction process (local mailing lists, coffee areas, etc.) so this checklist should be used in addition to that process. 

The current people who requests should be made to are in (brackets)

The line manager should do the following:

* If it’s a suggestion that impacts your team, 
    - [ ] Speak to the members of your team to discuss the change. 
    - [ ] Once a consensus has been agreed, please raise it with the appropriate Director (e.g. Training → Simon)

    - [ ] Discuss with your project manager or line manager as relevant (or both!) whether to raise this idea at the Ideas call. 
    - [ ] Follow the procedure outlined to discuss a new idea at the Ideas call.


## Raising a complaint within the SSI

Whether it’s a complaint about another member of the team or about a process/way of working, discuss in the first instance with your line / project manager, who will decide whether this needs to be escalated to the Directorate or a solution can be reached locally.

If you have a complaint about your project/line manager, 



* Arrange a meeting with them to discuss and provide constructive feedback*
* If this doesn’t solve the problem, speak to the Director that oversees your team first (refer to the organisational chart for further information). 
* The Director will likely raise the complaint with the rest of the Directorate and appropriate action will be taken. 

Note that if the complaint is with a non-SSI member of staff, you should refer to your university’s HR guidance.
