# Representing the SSI Externally

## A template brief with key points about the SSI when staff are representing us externally. 


## What representation involves

The SSI and our staff are frequently invited to events such as conferences, meetings, workshops, etc. You might be asked to represent the SSI at one of these events, as a general attendee, as a speaker or panelist, or as a representative in a meeting. During this time, you will be representing the SSI and may be asked to provide information on our objectives and our activities.

Resources and how to get help

You can ask in person or on Slack for help before an event. It’s not always possible, but the more advance notice you can give, the better. People who represent the SSI frequently, such as people in the directorate, will have advice and resources that you can re-use.



* The [midterm review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lTOegcS1uVMULdzh63r2JS761ZDr6HzK/view?usp=drive_link), which was published in 2023, provides an overview of the SSI and some of our major achievements. It is a very useful document to prepare you for representing the SSI.
* Presentations should use the [SSI slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OzN9CD6nM47CPgWwDl4ectNKbHiJyq_ODprhH4nzrt0/edit#slide=id.p) (which is also available as a [theme](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gls-j68EoH9a0rFKB7TIgTA3dp3nszBWBNhMc6EMcg8/edit#slide=id.g24bbf9d3dd1_0_553)).
* You can use the [People Hub](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/people-hub) on our website to review SSI staff and remind yourself of their roles.
* You can use [our website](https://www.software.ac.uk/) in general to familiarise yourself with our work. The [news and blog hub](https://www.software.ac.uk/news-and-blogs-hub) is a very useful resource for this purpose.
* You can request publicity materials, such as stickers, banners, and tablecloths, from the communications team. Please note you should request materials well in advance in case they need to be sent by post.

## What to say and what you can agree to

During events you will be asked questions about the SSI and its work. We conduct a huge range of work, so we can’t expect everyone to know all the details. There are two main principles to follow. You shouldn’t make public any information that the Directorate has not approved officially (e.g. if SSI gets funding but it hasn’t been officially announced, you shouldn’t tell people about it unless the Directorate has approved this).


### A short overview of the SSI

The SSI was founded in 2010 as the first organisation in the world dedicated to improving software in research. It was founded on the premise that helping individuals and institutions understand the vital role that software plays in research would accelerate progress in every field of scientific and academic endeavour.

Over the years, the Institute has advocated for and developed an understanding of the fundamental importance of research software, its developers and users, its requirements, and how software advances research in the UK.

We are innovative, highly collaborative, and undeterred by even the most obstinate problems. We are experts in working across disciplines and identifying the people within communities who can effect change. We have learned to focus on scalable enterprises that allow us to maximise the impact of our work. We are committed to improving equality, diversity, and inclusivity across all of our activities.

*We are a partnership of three UK universities: Edinburgh (led by EPCC), Manchester, and Southampton. *


### How are you funded?

Phase 4 of the SSI is supported by the UKRI through the Digital Research Infrastructure programme.


### How can I get involved?

We have different ways that people can get involved:



* Apply to become a Fellow
* Get involved delivering training
* Join a steering committee (for Collaborations Workshop or the Research Software Camps)
