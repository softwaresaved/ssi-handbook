## Recruitment and selection

Staff members participate in various stages of the recruitment and selection process of the Fellowship Programme, from outreach and advertising to reviewing applications and conducting interviews.

Specific roles include:



* Contributing to and delivery of the recruitment strategy and materials
* Evaluating shortlisting and selection criteria
* Shortlisting applications based on predetermined criteria
* Engaging with shortlisted Fellows during the Online Selection Day 
* Making final selection decisions in collaboration with other team members

Benefits for staff members:



* **Better Selection Better Fellows**: Diverse staff perspectives contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation of the candidates. Specifically, staff can identify candidates whose goals and values align with the goals and objectives of the SSI.
* **Professional development**: Staff members gain experience in recruitment and selection which they can apply to recruiting new staff members. 
* **Awareness and networking**: Staff members gain awareness of current topics in the research software landscape and the people engaged in these topics.
* **Increased staff investment**: Involving staff in the selection process increases their investment in the success of the Fellowship Programme and its Fellows.  
* **Potential collaborations**: Involving staff members in the selection process could benefit both Fellows and Staff by promoting collaboration and mentorship, each leveraging their own expertise.

## Progression of Fellows Ideas and Collaborations


### Requests to collaborate with Fellows

Please inform the Fellowship Lead of any staff requests for Fellows input or involvement in upcoming or current projects, collaborations, work groups etc. The Fellowship lead will discuss the request at the weekly Fellowship Planning and Operations meeting and decide on next steps. 


### Collaborating with Fellows

Please inform the Fellowship Manager as soon as possible of any upcoming or current projects or collaborations that involve Fellows, including grant proposals. 


### Progression of Fellows Ideas



* An initiative, study group, or project is identified by the Community Team as having potential for further development and/or relevant to the goals and objectives of the SSI or the Fellowship Programme. 
* The Fellowship Manager will report the idea at the SSI Research Meeting and discuss possible (financial) support or involvement of SSI staff members. 
    * If the All SSI Meeting is more appropriate, the idea will be presented there. 
* If the idea leads to a project or funding proposal, this will be reported at the All SSI meeting.

## Handle request for consultancy on Fellowship programmes (Shoaib)

Introduction:



* Source
    * Email to [info@software.ac.uk](mailto:info@software.ac.uk)
        * Fellowship Lead will handle this request
    * Any other member of the SSI has had a discussion with a group who are interested in running a Fellowship programme
        * Do introductions via email and hand over to the Fellowship Lead
            * As a courtesy it would be good to have a conversation or even a slack exchange with the Fellowship Lead to give them a heads up that this is coming
* Fellowship Lead to arrange to work with the other group to arrange an initial meeting
* Give advice on aims, scope, finance, tailoring and other aspects of the programme
* Decide on how much effort is needed (some things can be done for free)
    * Could offer to look at their initial plan
    * If the timing is right and there is a good fit - could offer to allow them to be reviewers on the next round of Fellowship - to gain experience
    * There could be other help - e.g. turning up to their launch event/webinar to talk about the benefits of being part of such a programme to lend credibility
    * Ask them to give credit/reference to the SSI programme 
    * If ongoing support is needed
        * This needs to be a further discussion
            * Better to have time costed in at the grant level
            * Otherwise separate consultancy arrangements are needed
            * 10% of time for coaching and consultancy working with a fellowship manager
            * If actual doing is needed that is a different discussion
* Ongoing connection
    * A forum of Fellowship Programmes was started but this will need reviving
        * Great for sharing practice
        * Could this be something we could get further network funding for
