# Data Management Plan and Data Sharing Agreement


## Introduction 

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document required by all funded projects.  A DMP outlines how data will be collected, stored, organised, protected, shared, and preserved throughout the project’s lifecycle. The full SSI-4 data management plan is stored in the University of Edinburgh RDM pages ([https://dmponline.ed.ac.uk/plans](https://dmponline.ed.ac.uk/plans)) and is also published on the SSI webpage ([https://www.software.ac.uk/data-management-plan](https://www.software.ac.uk/data-management-plan)).   A summary of the DMP is given below.

While most datasets held by the SSI are shared publicly, data sharing agreements (DSAs) are required for datasets containing sensitive information.  SSI-4 has a DSAa for the Fellowship and Mentorship program available HERE (lead by Oscar Seip and Shoaib Sulfi).

As Principal Investigator, Neil Chue Hong, is responsible for data management, with assistance from Kirsty Pringle and the SSI directorate. 


## Summary of the Data Management Plan

SSI-4 will include the following categories of studies:



* Studies into the research software community 
* Conducting collaborative research with participant researchers into effective EDIA interventions
* Analysing the effectiveness of SSI-4 programmes to support those working with research software.

Additionally data that is not part of a specific research study, but necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the Software Sustainability Institute will also be collected.

Various types of data will be collected, including research study data, software-related aggregated data, operational and financial data, and evaluation metrics.

Data will primarily be in digital formats such as CSV, text, code repositories, and survey datasets, with storage scaling according to project needs. Data collection methods include surveys, interviews, text and data mining, and software development, with a commitment to FAIR principle. Quality control measures will ensure data integrity through validation, testing, and adherence to community standards.

Non-sensitive data will be stored in Google Drive and GitHub, with backups at Edinburgh’s DataStore. Sensitive data will be processed on encrypted, password-secured devices, backed up to institutional repositories at multiple universities. Metadata will be recorded in the University of Edinburgh’s research outcomes system, and open data policies will be followed to make research outputs discoverable.

Long-term data preservation is ensured through repositories like Zenodo, with metadata and documentation facilitating reuse. Data security measures include compliance with ISO 27001 standards, encryption protocols, and controlled access. Sharing will be facilitated under open licenses (CC BY for data, BSD 3-clause for software), with some restrictions for personal, proprietary, or confidential data. Exclusive use periods for project data will be clearly defined before transitioning to broader access.

Governance of data access ensures compliance with ethical, contractual, and regulatory obligations, including anonymisation strategies where necessary. The Principal Investigator, Neil Chue Hong, oversees data management, with operational responsibilities delegated within the team. Policies from the University of Edinburgh govern data security, protection, and sharing. The DMP emphasises transparency, responsible data use, and long-term sustainability of research outputs.
