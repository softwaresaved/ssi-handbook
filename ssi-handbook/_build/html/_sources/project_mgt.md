# SSI Project Management Policy

At the SSI, we adopt a lightweight, flexible approach to project management. To ensure smooth operations and effective coordination, we expect all SSI project managers to plan ahead, ideally **at least one year in advance** where feasible.


## Tracking and Visibility

To maintain transparency and avoid conflicts, we use the [SSI-4 Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/softwaresaved/projects/30) on GitHub to track SSI and SSI-adjacent projects.

All project managers must create and maintain a tracking issue on the SSI-4 Roadmap for the duration of each project. If a project lasts longer than a quarter, it should be added to the roadmap as a tracking issue.

Keeping projects up to date in GitHub allows us to:



* Identify potential deadline clashes early and mitigate risks.
* Collaborate effectively across teams, ensuring PMO and Comms teams are aware of key requirements.
* Foster transparency, enabling all staff to see ongoing projects and share insights.

**Important:** This does **not** mean you must manage your entire project on GitHub. You are free to use any project management tools or styles that suit your workflow.

**Need help getting started? \
**Read the [Tracking issues guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jSOWrUPyPy71Exyh_f-vQ8m86e0n9IcQ3r7l8mb62fk/edit?usp=sharing), or arrange a 15-minute call with the [SSI Associate Director of Operations](mailto:s.aragon@software.ac.uk) for guidance.


## Benefits 

The SSI-4 Roadmap serves as a central hub for tracking projects, providing:



* Portfolio visibility – Everyone can see ongoing projects, promoting cross-team awareness.
* Early risk detection – Helps anticipate scheduling conflicts and resource constraints.
* Clear objectives from the start – Encourages structured planning and milestone tracking.
* A lightweight, low-maintenance approach – Keeps project tracking simple without adding administrative burden.



## Presenting at Strategy Quarterly Meetings

At each Strategy Quarterly Meeting, project managers will have the opportunity to present brief updates on their projects. Please prepare a one-minute lightning talk per project, covering:



* Project progress and upcoming work
* Key achievements and milestones
* Challenges or barriers faced

This is not an evaluation of deadlines but an opportunity to share insights, discuss lessons learned, and spark conversations during breaks and lunch.

If your project includes interesting findings, consider presenting them in more detail at a later Show & Tell session.

Slides are optional – A template will be provided soon.


## Frequently Asked Questions



1. **My official job title isn’t project manager, do I have to follow the project management procedures? **

    If you are responsible for managing a project, then you should follow the procedures as you are the contact person for the project. 

2. **My project doesn’t interact with other SSI teams (e.g. Community, Training, Communications) as much, should I follow the procedures? **

    Yes, it’s important that every SSI project has a tracking issue, which shows high-level milestones, deadlines & key dates, and is reported at various SSI team meetings as appropriate and required to ensure visibility and accountability. 

3. **How long will it take me to update my tracking issue every month? **

    Once the tracking issue has been created, we estimate less than 5 minutes per project. Some managers have more projects in their portfolio—the time spent depends on the number of projects.
