# Web content

## Blog content and social media
We aim to publish one blog post or news item per day at 10am and/or 2pm. We also publicise on Twitter and LinkedIn. We normally schedule tweets in advance using Hootsuite, which can be accessed through the @SoftwareSaved account.

### Step-by-step: Adding a blog post/news item

1. Log into the SSI website using your staff credentials. 
2. Go to: Manage > + Add content > Blog entry or News article.
3. Copy and paste content. Content should have already been edited/proofread (going back to the author(s) for major changes). Make sure all URLs work and that relevant information is linked (for example: organisations, articles, explanations of concepts, etc.)
4. Add images to file manager then add in the “Choose image” field (cover image) and then add the same image to the top of the body (aligned to the right). 
**Always add “alternative text” for accessibility purposes. 
Always add a caption with attribution source (see Images section below).**
5. Make any relevant edits to the HTML source. If there is any embedded content (tweets, videos, etc.), change from Basic HTML to Full HTML (at the bottom of the body box). 
6. Add tags, teams and author of the blog post.
7. Add a summary of the page (click on summary to expand field).
8. Publish entry. *If you’re uploading a blog post/news item in advance and saving as “unpublished”, remember to change the “authoring information” on the side to the correct date, so that the URL is updated too.* 

## Images
### CC-BY
We source images for the website from Unsplash, Pixabay or Flickr. All images from Unsplash and Pixabay are CC-BY. Some Flickr images are CC-BY but this needs to be verified. When posting an image on the website, add the following caption: “Image by [NAME]” and link their names to their Unsplash/Pixabay/Flickr profiles. 
Images work best at a 400x300px size and they should be less than 2MB.
### From events
We host images from our events at Google Photos using the software.ac.uk@gmail.com account. 
### Summary
Always add a summary to any new content. This goes in line with accessibility regulations.

## Editorial calendar

- Add schedule for blog posts, news items, tweets and publicity rounds to the calendar. Event organisers have access to it and can see the events, but not add or modify them. Other people consult the calendar, so make sure it’s up to date.
