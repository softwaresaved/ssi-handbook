# Training Requests Brief

## Procedure for handling external requests to run or partner to run a training workshop or develop a training course material

This document summarises the steps to take when we are approached by external parties to provide training services. This can be a request to plan and deliver a training workshop, to develop a training material, to partner on different training activities (e.g. workshops, summer schools, project proposals), or provide training consultancy.

**Project request stage**

When approached by an external party about any SSI training services, the initial SSI contact finds out and captures details of the training/partnership request:



* target audience, (approximate) number of learners, proposed dates, type of training, topics, maturity level, delivery mode (online/in person; instructor-led/supported self-learning), budget, etc. 
* The initial requirements capturing should be recorded as a GitHub issue in the [training-activities repository](https://github.com/softwaresaved/training-activities/issues) using the [training request template](https://github.com/softwaresaved/training-activities/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/training_request.yml); this issue is then used for any further discussions and follow-ups.

**Project scoping stage**



* Set up the initial scoping discussion with Aleks/Steve to meet with the proposer and expand on detail and set expectations, clarify budget, potential dates and scheduling.
* **Gate: Aleks decides to proceed to the next step based on initial scoping**
* Following this, Aleks determines if this is a good fit for including external training provider(s):
    * How to include others
        * Delegate: completely delegate to another group, e.g. other RSGs, training groups, collaborators, etc.
        * Take on: we do this ourselves
        * Facilitate: we partially delegate/collaborate with others to deliver and we take the role of the facilitator
    * Decision criteria: e.g. based on nature of training, whether it's predominantly delivery, its strategic importance, available skills, staff availability/scheduling constraints and the overall effort needed to deliver this (e.g. whether this projects involves handling payments)
* **Gate: Aleks consults with Simon (and optionally Neil) about opportunity, and obtains the official sign-off from the Directorate**
* Aleks sets the project manager for this project
* Aleks/project manager: 
    * Gets initial commitment from staff involved (including external collaborators) 
    * Schedules the event based on staff availability
    * Works on the financial aspects of the project (e.g. how is people’s time costed - a daily rate for shorter projects up to 2 weeks or % of FTE for projects longer than 2 weeks, which SSI sites the money is going to, how is this being handled, what is the “expiration date” on the money, etc.) 
    * Records the details so far in the SSI4 project roadmap

**Project planning stage**



* Project manager comes up with a full internal project plan (and records it in the SSI4 project roadmap)
    * Publishes the responsibilities for who is delivering what and by when 
    * Decides on credit and IP ownership (e.g. in the case of industrial partners)
    * Makes a communications schedule to advertise/promote the event and highlight our involvement
* Aleks/project manager generates a quotation for the work (with the appropriate SSI sites that will be leading the work and handling finances) and use it to get a Purchase Order (PO) from the proposer (if needed)
* Aleks/project manager highlights the “expiration date” on any funds generated with the appropriate SSI site to make sure the money is spent accordingly and on time

Template:
