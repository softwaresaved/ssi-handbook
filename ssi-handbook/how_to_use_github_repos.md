# How to use the SSI GitHub Repos

All SSI staff should host the repositories for new projects on the [SSI GitHub](https://github.com/softwaresaved).

If you’re new to GitHub, you can find guidelines about how to create new repos [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories) 


## SSI repositories requirements


### New repo

Please ensure your new repository has the following information before you start adding any issues to it:



* Readme 
* Keywords
* Relevant links to resources
* Contact details
* Relevant team (including non-SSI staff) added to the repo (see section below)


### Archiving a repo

After a project ends, it’s good practice to archive a repo. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories)


### Adding external contributors

To add external contributors to a specific SoftwareSaved GitHub repository, please contact Neil Chue Hong or Selina Aragon. 

A new team will be created and given access to the requested repositories. Please don’t add people to individual repositories. 


### Repositories relevant to all staff

* Institute issues
* Website issues
